## Description
This GitHub repository contains a group project completed during a 2-day hackathon as part of our Data Analysis course at Wild Code School. The project was developed by Luana, Patrick, Lala, and me, focusing on creating a Streamlit application that predicts salaries for data careers in the US based on career criteria, using the XGBoost machine learning model. The project involved data cleaning, preparation, and analysis.


## Project Stages
The project involved several stages:

* **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Data exploration, trend identification, and data cleaning
* **Data Visualization**: Creating key graphics for the dashboard.
* **Prediction Model**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict salaries.
* **Interface**: Developing an application that features a salary prediction search engine based on criteria entered by the user, along with a dashboard for KPI analysis.
